# Architecture Decision Records

Follow the lightweight MADR-style format for each decision:

- File name: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-short-title.md`
- Sections: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences.

Keep ADRs short and focused. Reference them from relevant service docs and include links in pull requests when decisions are implemented.
